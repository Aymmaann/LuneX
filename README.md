# LuneX

LuneX is a cloud-powered cryptocurrency tracking platform that provides real-time insights, historical analysis, and AI-driven volatility alerts. This project leverages multiple cloud services for authentication, data storage, and analytics. **LuneX is currently under development.**

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Implements OAuth authentication, allowing secure sign-in and user data storage in a MongoDB database.
- **Dashboard:** Displays the top 100 cryptocurrencies with real-time pricing and market details.
- **Detailed Crypto View:** Each cryptocurrency has a modal that provides:
  - Historical data for the last 30 days.
  - A built-in currency converter to check the equivalent value in USD.
- **Trending Page:** Highlights trending cryptocurrencies with:
  - A modal showing the price trend for the last 24 hours.
  - Dynamic investment advice based on current growth or fall rate (e.g., "Promising," "Be Cautious," "Risky to Invest").
- **Upcoming Features:**
  - **AI-Powered Volatility Alerts:** BigQuery analytics and vector AI to detect significant price changes in user-tracked cryptos.
  - **Multi-Cloud Integration:** Store user-selected cryptos in Firestore, analyze in BigQuery, and use AWS services for email notifications when significant price fluctuations occur.

## Cloud Services Used

- **OAuth (Google Cloud):**

  - Analyzing historical crypto data and volatility patterns.  
  - Identifying correlations between trading volume and price changes.  
  - Calculating moving averages and trend analysis for better market insights.  
  - Aggregating data for custom user reports (e.g., most volatile assets over time).  

- **Vertex AI (Google Cloud):**  
  - Calculating **Volatility Score** to assess how much a cryptocurrency's price fluctuates.  
  - Predicting **Expected Price Rise/Drop** based on historical trends and market conditions.  
  - **Trend Prediction** (Bullish, Bearish, Neutral) using ML models trained on past price actions.  

- **AWS EC2 (Amazon Web Services):**  
  - Hosting the backend services and API for real-time cryptocurrency tracking.  
  - Ensuring scalability and performance for high-traffic data requests.  

- **AWS SES (Simple Email Service):**  
  - Sending automated alerts for sudden price changes.  

### Useful BigQuery Analyses for Users  

- **Price Correlation Analysis:** Find relationships between different coins (e.g., how Bitcoinâ€™s price affects altcoins).  
- **Whale Activity Detection:** Track large transactions and how they impact price volatility.  
- **Seasonal Trends:** Identify patterns like "weekend dips" or "Monday recoveries" based on historical data.  
- **Market Sentiment Analysis:** If combined with news/social media data, gauge sentiment around a coin.
